        I've never been truly able to express myself without sounding like a problem or asking for too much.
        For some reason in life i always end up as the person who's asking/begging for something or someone, every single time theres a girl in my life it always goes the same way.. its always me asking for too much or asking/begging to be loved.
        For once i thought you were initiating whatever is happening because i thought we had mutual feelings but at the end of the day i ended up being the dog who once again begs to be loved
        I never had thought that we'd be in such a situationship but we are and communication is the key which we both are currently lacking, at the end of the day i believe its no ones fault because we're young stupid and immature.
        For the past couple of days you've been very lovey dovey with me which is cool i understand maybe u had a moment of weakness and i dont mind it at all but if ur gonna make me feel loved then continue with what ur doing not just halfway
        it and then act like nothing ever happened like we're complete strangers, yk ill always be there for u even if i block u or we stop talking but im there its just personal issues disturbing our ground rules so Urwa im gonna pour my heart out
        and tell u why have i been a lil weird lately.. I've just been extremely jealous, i know ill never be him i can never be as good of a man as him or as perfect as him to you but it hurts to know that after all we've been through after all youve said to me 
        and how i thought u were in love with me and we were going some where that you would choose Ahmed any day over me. its completely understandable and it doesnt matter because i know at the end of the day ur always gonna prioritize and love him more than me
        although it doesnt matter but it makes me extremely jealous when u talk about him when u post stories about him saying u miss him and song lyrics about him cuz i believed we had smth but im wrong.
        idk if there was nothing to begin with between us but if there was this certainly aint it. If you've come half way then go all the way cuz i feel fkin abandoned and like always its me cryin for everything because no one else cares enough to think what this nigga might be thinking and whats he goin through
        now im left with the lil attachment i got with u and the other part in my head that says i should block u and never talk to u again but i dont wanna do that
        so yeah idk whats happening now tbh but i just got 1 last question..
        do u wanna date me with all seriousness no bullshit?</p>
